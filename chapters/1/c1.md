## First, a bit of background information
SE Nitro is a webcomic created by [Radvylf Programs](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/79857/radvylf-programs) from [Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) (hereafter to be referred to as CGCC). It is mostly a comic version of in-jokes from the Stack Exchange and its [chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms?tab=site&sort=active&host=codegolf.stackexchange.com). I *will* be linking to a lot of chat transcripts to prove my points. This explainer was created by [Seggan](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/107299/seggan) from CGCC. The comic itself can be found [here](https://se-nitro.surge.sh/#1-1-1).

## And now, on to the comic!

*Person 1: How u fly?*

*Person 2: Must haz NITRO*



[SE Nitro](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/conversation/mathcat-gets-se-nitro) is a joke on CGCC about a "premium" version of Stack Exchange that allows you to use Discord-style reactions in chat. Supposedly, [Wheat Wizard](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/56656/wheat-wizard) had obtained it, after which [mathcat](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/96037/mathcat) (the main antagonist of the comic) stole it from him. Apparently, SE Nitro can also give you flight. This panel might also be a reference to the [antigravity XKCD](https://xkcd.com/353/).

*Ginger: mathcat, no!*



mathcat now decides to use his new powers for [conquering the world](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/62583117#62583117), and is determined to destroy [Ginger](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/108218/ginger), who threatens to foil his conquest.

*Ginger: Don't make me use... GITHUB PERKS!*



[Github Perks](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/conversation/ginger-gets-github-perks) is a related joke about the "only thing that can counter SE Nitro." Ginger is the only one who has it.

(( 7 ))
*Ginger: now... you die*



Ginger attacks mathcat, apparently with a shield and nunchucks.

(( 8 ))
*mathcat: or do I?*



On the left is shown what is [apparently a nether portal](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/133489?m=60244160#60244160). Later, mathcat flees into there.
