<h2>First, a bit of background information</h2><p>SE Nitro is a webcomic created by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/79857">Rydwolf Programs</a> (known as “Redwolf Programs” in the comic) from <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">Code Golf Stack Exchange</a> (hereafter to be referred to as CGCC). It is mostly a comic version of in-jokes from the Stack Exchange and its <a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms?tab=site&amp;sort=active&amp;host=codegolf.stackexchange.com">chat</a>. I <i>will</i> be linking to a lot of chat transcripts to prove my points. This explainer was created by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/107299">Seggan</a> from CGCC. The comic itself can be found <a href="https://se-nitro.surge.sh/#1-1-1">here</a>.</p><h2>And now, on to the comic!</h2><p><a href="https://se-nitro.surge.sh/#1-1-1"><img src="https://se-nitro.surge.sh/comics/p1/c1/1.png"></a></p><blockquote><p><em>Person 1: How u fly?</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Person 2: Must haz NITRO</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/conversation/mathcat-gets-se-nitro">SE Nitro</a> is a joke on CGCC about a “premium” version of Stack Exchange that allows you to use Discord-style reactions in chat. Supposedly, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/56656">Wheat Wizard</a> had obtained it, after which <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/96037">math scat</a> (the main antagonist of the comic) stole it from him. Apparently, SE Nitro can also give you flight.
